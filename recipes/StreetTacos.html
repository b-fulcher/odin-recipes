    <h1>Authentic Baja-Mexican Street Tacos (Carne Asada)</h1>
    <img src="../images/streetTacos.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        On weekend getaways from San Diego to the beaches in Ensenada and Rosarito 
        (Baja California), I found my favorite meal in the delicious soft skirt 
        steak tacos sold by the taqueria street vendors. This recipe tastes exactly 
        how I remember them - without having to make the trip across the border. 
        Muy bueno! Top with some freshly squeezed lime juice and spicy salsa if you like.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups fresh orange juice, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>3 pounds trimmed skirt steaks</li>
        <li>16 (6 inch) white corn tortillas, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 white onion, chopped, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 small bunch fresh cilantro, chopped, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine orange juice, 2 tablespoons cilantro, lime juice, garlic, salt, 
            pepper, cumin, and cayenne in a large freezer bag. Submerge skirt steaks 
            in the marinade. Seal the bag, squeezing out as much air as possible. 
            Refrigerate, 1 to 8 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat a grill to medium-high. Grill the steaks until hot and firm in 
            the center or to your preferred doneness, 6 to 8 minutes per side. 
            Transfer steaks to a flat work surface and slice as thinly as possible 
            against the grain.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat corn tortillas on the grill or in a microwave. Keep tortillas warm 
            in a folded sheet of aluminum foil covered by a thick towel.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add steak to each tortilla and top with white onion and cilantro.
        </li>
    </ol>
